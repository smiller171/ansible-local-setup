## Fifteen
"Fifteen is a faux bitmap font. This font is designed to be used as a monotype font for use in a terminal, or at a larger size, to look like an over scaled bitmap. It is designed for 15 pixel use. It is as narrow as I could make it, and works well in a 132 column terminal window. It is, of course, monospaced and has clearly distinct 1I and l, and the zero is slashed. Character set is limited in this first release to ascii + smart quotes."

## Fixedsys
"Fixedsys is a family of raster monospaced fonts. The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded characters are wider than non-bolded, unlike other monospace fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named "System". For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad."

## GNU Unifont
"This version provides full coverage of the Unicode 7.0 Basic Mulitlingual Plane (BMP). The BMP is the first Unicode "plane" of 65,536 code points, and has character encoding for most of the world's modern scripts.  
As of 20 June 2008 (by coincidence the Summer Solstice), GNU Unifont had a glyph for every printable code point in the Unicode BMP. That version covered Unicode 5.1, which was the current version at the time. Roman Czyborra began this effort in 1998, with earlier efforts starting around 1994. The 2008 release was thus the culmination of a more than ten-year effort."

## Inconsolata
"Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.  
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck."

"I use the free Inconsolata font (by Raph Levien) to program and as shell font, and I like it a lot. I have seen this blog post: "Adding straight single and double quotes to Inconsolata", that offers Inconsolata-dz:
So I've uses FontForge to modify more his Inconsolata version, to fix some of the things I don't like of Inconsolata."

The Liberation fonts are intended as free, open-source replacements of the aforementioned commercial fonts."

## Source Code Pro
"One particularly surprising aspect of Source Sans’s release was the amount of interest generated by the teaser graphic of the monospaced version. It seemed that this generated about as much buzz as the fonts that we released. Brackets, the open source code editor created by Adobe, has just recently implemented the regular weight of Source Code into their project. Likewise, the font will be integrated into Adobe Edge Code, which was announced this morning at our Create the Web event in San Francisco. The complete family of six weights will also be available as part of our new Adobe Edge Web Fonts service."

Whenever something bugged me, I refined the design and could instantly evaluate if a change was an improvement."
